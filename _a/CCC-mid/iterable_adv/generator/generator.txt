- generator function can have return statement.

- why generator?
1. generator function is easy to implement than the iterator class
2. memory efficient such as produce infinite data. Otherwise, infinite data can not store in memory
3. pipelining by connecting generators
file => the third column => ints of third column => sum
with open('play.log') as file:
    col_of_mins = (line.split()[2] for line in file)
    int_col_of_mins = (int(x) for x in col_of_mins)
    print('Total mins: ',sum(int_col_of_mins))
