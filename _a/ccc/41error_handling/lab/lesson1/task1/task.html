In this lab we will be reinforcing the idea of exceptions. Recall from class that exceptions are a construct that allow
<br>
you as the programmer to elegantly handle issues that may or may not arise from running your code as opposed to just
<br>
crashing. They may allow a user to understand what they did wrong so they can fix it in the future instead of a simple
<br>
general error message.<br>
In this first task you see that we have given you the code to attempt to open a file, however this file does not <br>
exist. Surround it in a try statement that has an except clause that catches the IO error and prints a message <br> to
the user
