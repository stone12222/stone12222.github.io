Recall the from the notes the finally clause of a try statement. This clause allows you to execute code regardless of
<br>
whether or not there is an exception thrown. In this exercise we have given you a loop: the first time through the loop
<br>
there is an error because of an attempted division by zero however we still want to print to the user that the <br>
loop executed. <br>
add a try statement in the loop that has an except clause AND a finally clause.<br>
The except clause should print a message to the user informing them that a division by zero was attempted.<br>
The finally clause should print out how many times we have been through the loop.
