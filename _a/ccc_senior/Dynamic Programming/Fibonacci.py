# What is Dynamic programming:
'''
if a problem is composed by the subproblems
1. solving each subproblem just once, and storing their results (knowledge)
2. use the result or combine the results to calculate other subproblem,
and storing the results again (bottom-up)
1+1=2, 2+1=3, 3+1=4

example:
Fibonacci sequence loop version is an example (bottom up)
Fibonacci recursion + memoization is an example (used in top down)

# Why called dynamic programming:
The name was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems,
and it sounded impressive.

# Why it is useful:
1. efficient in time
