                        a basic SDLC life cycle from planning to deploying as a team. I worked on documenting the developing
                        process and providing updates to our sponsor - our computer engineering teacher. I also worked
                        on assigning tasks to everyone and organized weekly meetings. I Mainly coded the codes for I/O on
                        hardware and helped other programmers with debugging and quality assurance. The finished project was
                        later presented to the school principal and was later used for school promotion.

                        browsers and window sizes. During the project, I used tools like Brackets IDE and GitHub. I
                        also used my knowledge in UI design and web testing to ensure the website was functioning
                        and as lovely as possible. The project is ongoing, and I provide maintenance and information
