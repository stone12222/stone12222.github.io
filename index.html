My rank is currently Flight Sergeant, and I am waiting to get Warrant Officer Second Class. I have been a part of the flag party as a guard. I attended the remembrance day parade and guarded the memorial overnight. I have also taken leadership roles such as second in command, flight commander and deputy squadron warrant officer, where I command a group of cadets on parades and regular training. I am also an instructor, and on a typical weekly training night, I would teach lessons to lower-level cadets. I also passed the harshed selection of exams, file reviews and in-person interviews and got my offer to the pilot scholarship program. However, with the sudden appearance of COVID-19, I could not attend.

Throughout the various competitions, I achieved a team bronze, a team silver and an individual bronze. My marksmanship skills improved throughout the years. I started as a backup member and worked my way up to the team's top shooter. I'm classified as a distinguished Marksman (top-level). Being one of the few distinguished Marksmen in my local squadron, I am happy and willing to pass my knowledge and experience in marksmanship down if in-person training resumes.

I Loved the concept of simulating debates in the UN setting and enjoyed having meaningful discussions with peers. I attended many different conferences and tried solving real-world issues that had happened. Although due to the recent reform of the club, there aren't exactly any executive members. I am still taking a leadership role within the club. As a veteran member of the club, I took the responsibility of delivering general knowledge such as formality and the flow of the debate. I also had chances to help monitor and lead a few club meetings and discussions.
